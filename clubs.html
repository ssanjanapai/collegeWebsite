        <h1>Cultural Activity Team -CAT</h1>
        <img src="CAT.JPG" style=" width:900; height:500px; border-radius:30%;">
        
        <p class="lead">The cultural activity team (CAT) is the eminence of creativity in RNSIT. The team uses its honed and polished set of skills to collectively put up a fest that the rest of the college can enjoy. There are two fests that the Cultural Activity Team has to its name:<br>

         PARICHAY: The Intra college extravaganza that features a frantic jig for two trophies fought for by all the seven branches- The spirit of Parichay and the Talent of Parichay. Parichay boasts of over 50 events organised with utmost care by the Events committee of CAT. The Talent of Parichay is awarded to the branch that has the most number of wins in these events. The Spirit of Parichay is awarded to the branch with most number of Participants in all the events. Overall, Parichay has been very well received by the students and continues to be a tradition that is rooted within the spirit of RNSIT as an institution.<br>

          PANTHEON: The Bi-annual Inter-college fest that to this day, is a brand name among students. Pantheon boasts of a very large number of events and tests the CAT to its limits in terms of managing and scheduling. Pantheon has also hosted many popular acts such as Agam, Lagori, Aathma, Argenil productions among many others. Pantheon has seen a footfall over 3000 everytime and has been the pride of RNSIT's cultural pursuits. It has successfully put RNSIT on the Cultural Map. The word Pantheon refers to the deities of a religion collectively. It is safe to say, that the fest lives up to this name.<br>

           The CAT comprises of unsung heroes who selflessly work to put a fest up for the rest of the college and do not participate in any events. The CAT also owes its smooth functioning to the Cultural head; Prof. T.S Bhagavath Singh, who is an integral part of the team which would not have existed without the work put in by him.<br> </p>
